I've always admired the [South African Youth
Struggle](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/youth-struggle)
and if you grew up much like me, then at some point in your
early childhood you may have seen the 1992 classic
[Sarafina](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105316/) starring [Whoopi Goldberg](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000155/?ref_=tt_cl_t2).

The movie is centred around the introduction of the
Afrikaans language as a means of teaching which leads to
outrage driving the plot from there, but this isn't a movie
review or an attempt to tug at your nostalgia.
What my young mind at the time couldn't perceive hidden
behind the musical notes of what I still think is a
masterpiece despite it's 6.4 IMDb rating was the chorus cry
for change.

I live (like many of my readers) in Zambia, a country that
has known only peace in it's 56 (soon to be 57) years of
independence. And after 57 years of "**_independence_**,"
it's saddening to see a nation come full circle, to reach a
point where a government silences the voices of its people,
fights its youth for questioning it and threatens violence
to those that seek order. That's how long it took a nation,
57 years to begin fighting the very spark that ignited the
flames of the Zambian fight for freedom, to begin silencing
the voices that'll carry influence into the next generation.
Why? Because they fear us, they fear what we're capable of
because they were once us, **_YOUTH_**.

You're probably might be reading this thinking to yourself,
"What is he talking about, Zambia is a free nation." And
you're right by your standards by mine however, this
certainly isn't independence.

If it is then why are citizens being threatened, why are our
rights being taken away from us, why can't we express
ourselves like we once could and why can't we rally in the
streets to protest against an unjust system, **_WHY?_**

The threat is apparent, to stifle a revolution quench the
flame before it spreads.

Now, I can't speak for a time before I became analytically
observant (ignorance is bliss), the more I look at the
current state of affairs the more I wonder exactly where we
are going.
What does it take for a people to breathe a sigh of relief
and exclaim "Now, we are free!"?

Silence has always been the death of any revolution.
